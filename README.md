## Description
A weather dashboard listing weather information including, humidity, chance of rain etc.  Additionally, this was an exercise praticing third-party API calls and loading returned information correctly.

## Usage
Intended user of this application is for everyday individuals. Thus, the layout which loads the weather information in an easy to read format for everyday individuals.  

## Approach
My approach was to based upon teh input field value to make a call, using jquery target the search input field and simultanously make the call and add to the search history list.  Next was to make a call for the next four days and applying icons using fontawesome based on various conditions of the weather.  One symbol will appear per parameter based on the temperature in the metric system.  Unfortunately due to the demand of the project and how it is more critical than the homework assignment I chose to have the homework to a satisfactory standard and focus on the group project instead.

## How to use

Type in the name of the city you wish to call and the apporpriate weather data will appear for the next four days from today.

## updates to come:

Dates instead of next four days however time has run out before the deadline, additionally was unable to meet the refresh criteria and button search criteria.
